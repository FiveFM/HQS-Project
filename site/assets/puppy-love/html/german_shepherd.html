    Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
    They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and
    an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden retrievers are well suited to residency
    <img src="../german-shepherd-2.jpg" alt="" /> in suburban or country environments. They shed copiously, particularly
    at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland
    in the mid-19th century. The averafe lifespan of a golden retriever is 10-12 years. <img
